Level Editor


The custom Inspector for the Level Data Scriptable Object allows for quick editing (usage is in infoboxes), and all changes are automatically persisted to the asset.

Custom Inspector Controls (LevelEditorSettings)

You can use keyboard shortcuts while the cursor is hovering over a tile object:

W key: Toggles the tile type to a Person object.

W + [Number Key 1-9]: Assigns the color of the Person object (e.g., pressing 2 makes it Blue).

M key: Sets the person type to Mysterious (Special Type).

D key: Sets the person type back to Default.

All shortcut configurations are managed through the LevelEditorSettings Scriptable Object asset.
